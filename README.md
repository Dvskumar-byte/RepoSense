# RepoSense 🔍  
**GitHub Repository Intelligence & Code Analysis Tool**

RepoSense is a developer-focused application that analyzes GitHub repositories and allows users to **ask questions about the codebase** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  
Instead of manually reading large repositories, RepoSense helps you understand **code structure, data flow, and logic instantly**.

## 🚀 What Problem Does RepoSense Solve?

Reading unfamiliar or large GitHub repositories is slow and error-prone.  
RepoSense solves this by:
- Loading a repository automatically
- Chunking and embedding the code
- Using an LLM to answer **natural language questions** about the repo

This is especially useful for:
- Developers onboarding to new projects  
- Students learning real-world codebases  
- Recruiters evaluating code understanding  
- Hackathons & academic demos
